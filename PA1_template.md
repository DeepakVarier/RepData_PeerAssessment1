**What is the average daily activity pattern?**

Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)


```r
## Create a line plot for the Daily activity pattern by interval

actInterval <- ddply(actData,"interval", summarize, avgSteps=mean(steps, na.rm=TRUE))
head(actInterval)
```

```

```

**Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?**


```r
maxSteps <- actInterval[which.max(actInterval$avgSteps),1] #835th interval has the max avg
```

*On average, across all the days in the dataset, the maximum number of steps occurs during interval 835!*


**Imputing missing values**

Note that there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing values (coded as NA). The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations or summaries of the data.

Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)

```r
missingVal <- sum(is.na(actData$steps)) #2304
```

*There are 2304 NA values in the dataset.*


Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

*I employed a strategy where I impute the 5-minute interval mean.*

Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.


```r
actData2 <- actData
actInterval2 <- ddply(actData2,"interval", summarize, avgSteps=mean(steps, na.rm=TRUE))
head(actInterval2)
```

```
##   interval  avgSteps

*The new mean is 37.3825996 compared to the value of 9354.2295082. Similarly, the new median is 0, compared to the old value of 10395.*

Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

*This histogram is more centralizied, with more values landing on the average, whereas the tails are mostly not affected.*

**Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?**

For this part the weekdays() function may be of some help here. Use the dataset with the filled-in missing values for this part.

Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels â€“ â€œweekdayâ€ and â€œweekendâ€ indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.


```r
actData2$dayType <- ifelse(weekdays(as.Date(actData2$date)) %in% c("Saturday","Sunday"), "weekend", "weekday")
actData2$dayType <- as.factor(actData2$dayType)
levels(actData2$dayType)
```

```
## [1] "weekday" "weekend"
```

Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). The plot should look something like the following, which was creating using simulated data:

```r
intplot2 <- ddply(actData2,.(interval,dayType), summarize, avgSteps=mean(steps, na.rm=TRUE))
head(intplot2)
```

```
##   interval dayType   avgSteps
## 1        0 weekday 2.25115304
## 2        0 weekend 0.21462264
## 3        5 weekday 0.44528302
## 4        5 weekend 0.04245283
## 5       10 weekday 0.17316562
## 6       10 weekend 0.01650943
```

```r
intPlot <- ggplot(intplot2, 
            aes(x=interval,
